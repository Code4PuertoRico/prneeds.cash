You'll need node.js, yarn, and our airtable key. 

```
export AIRTABLE_KEY=<key>
yarn
gatsby develop
```

Visit localhost:8000 and voilá. 

To deploy, just push to the prod branch 🤷🏽‍♂️.

If you make any changes to the Airtable base, you need to deploy for changes to be reflected. Add a line to `airtable.revision` with details of the airtable update and push to prod.
